## <a name="intro">Introduction</a>
* This is the ranging sensor to power up the LED when objects are nearby.

## <a name="parts">Step 1 - Prepare Parts</a>
* [Parts for my project](https://github.com/minhnguyen999/Smart-Mirror/blob/master/documentation/CENG317-PartsForSmartMirror.xlsx)<br>
* Arduino Uno
* LED
* Cable to connect Arduino to computer
* PCB

## <a name="time">Step 2 - Timing Plan</a>
* This project should be divided into 2 parts: planning and implementation: planning include the first two steps which should take 1 week; the other part should be done in 2 weeks: first week on the Breadboard and test, the second week is to do with PCB and enclosure  .

## <a name="case">Step 7 - Enclosure</a>
* Go to website Makercase to design then download the .svg file
* Use CorelDraw to open the .svg file then laser print the case

## <a name="unit">Unit Testing</a>
* It's possible to create a thousand of products like this without step 4. Because when you assure the test of the first product works, the others will do the same. So we can skip step 4.
