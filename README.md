# Smart Mirror - Ultra Sonic Sensor (Light Sensor)
 
# Step 1: buy the following items:
# [Parts for my project](https://github.com/minhnguyen999/Smart-Mirror/blob/master/documentation/CENG317-PartsForSmartMirror.xlsx)<br>

# Step 2: design it with Fritzing:
# [Design](https://github.com/minhnguyen999/Smart-Mirror/blob/master/documentation/TuanMinhNguyen2.fzz)
# Breadboard design - [Breadboard](https://github.com/minhnguyen999/Smart-Mirror/blob/master/documentation/breadboard1.png)
# PCB design - [PCB](https://github.com/minhnguyen999/Smart-Mirror/blob/master/documentation/TuanMinhNguyen_pcbNEW.png)
# Schematic design - [Schematic](https://github.com/minhnguyen999/Smart-Mirror/blob/master/documentation/TuanMinhNguyen_schem1.png)<br>

# Step 3: test the design with breadboard in Ariduino software app with following code:

# Breadboard Light Sensor Off - [Light Off](https://github.com/minhnguyen999/Smart-Mirror/blob/master/documentation/IMG_4305.HEIC)
# Breadboard Light Sensor On - [Light On](https://github.com/minhnguyen999/Smart-Mirror/blob/master/documentation/IMG_4309.HEIC)<br>

# Step 4: if step 3 succeeds, laser print the PCB and solder pin header into the PCB

# Status: I have uploaded new pictures of my soldered PCB compared to previous week and the PCB design in Fritzing , i have corrected some connection and soldered again then now it runs great.
